                <h2>My name is Miriam</h2>

                <p> In 2021 I started my journey in becoming a Software Developer. And rediscovered a old love.</p>

                <p> Computer Science were the first university studies I took before switching to the Humanities. What at first does not seem to be a good career choice was the best decision for me because my cultural studies gave
                    me an understanding of the context of technology, how innovations spread and impact our culture.</p>

                <p>In Software Development I find a close connection between culture and technology, because software is made for people affecting their private lives and business. In the development process itself I can adapt my skills like analytical thinking, efficiency, creativity and curiosity. 
                    From my professional experience I bring strong communicative skills and experience in leading art exhibition projects as a Project manager.</p>

                    <h2>Wine cellar management application</h2>
                    <p>During my diploma course in Java Software Developmemt the task was to create a software project and project documentation.<br>
                    I decided to create a minimalist wine cellar management desktop app where where you can save your wines with all the essential informations, 
                    like producer, vintage, category, wine style etc.<br>The user can see all wines in the cellar in a table view and search/filter for producers, styles, regions, wine shops etc. 
                    The start page gives an overview of the collection: number of bottles, value, 
                    diagrams showing the wine categories and styles and a list view with favorite wines.<br>
